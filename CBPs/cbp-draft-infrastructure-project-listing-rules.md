## Abstract
IC is known as a decentralized cloud, and the development of the IC ecosystem requires a large amount of infrastructure, so CBD has made the promotion of infrastructure as one of its main goals.

## Motivation
Having a rich, high-quality infrastructure accelerates the entire IC ecosystem, allowing developers to have a rich infrastructure layer to support and focus on application development.

## Specification
 
**What projects can be added to the CBD infrastructure projects list?**

Infrastructure projects on IC, e.g., infrastructure that can be used as development by most projects, services that can be integrated and used by most projects, etc.

**How to join the CBD infrastructure projects list?**

1. The infrastructure project development team submits CBP github PR according to cbp-0001
2. A member of the CBD technical committee will communicate with the infrastructure project team to help prepare the project for listing, such as the necessary quality checks and documentation requirements, to ensure that the project listing is available to the IC eco-developers
3. The CBD Technical Committee will consolidate this PR after step 2 is completed

**What are the benefits of joining the CBD infrastructure projects list?**

1. CBD has IC eco-renowned technical experts who will give professional advice on infrastructure projects
2. Projects approved by CBD can gain the trust of IC eco-developers and thus get more users and feedback
3. CBD has an international community promotion channel, which can make the project reach the whole IC ecosystem quickly.
4. As an infrastructure project, the team will be invited to join the technical committee by CBD (CBD only supports individuals to join).

## Rationale
CBD will not encroach on the interests and reputation of infrastructure repository developers, and CBD exists only to help build more high-quality infrastructure repositories and help the developers of these infrastructure repositories gain more attention and more users.
